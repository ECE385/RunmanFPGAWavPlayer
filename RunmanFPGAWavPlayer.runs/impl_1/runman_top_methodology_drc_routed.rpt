2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-4#1 Critical Warning
Invalid primary clock redefinition on a clock tree  
Invalid clock redefinition on a clock tree. The primary clock data_manager_i/clk_wiz_0/inst/clk_in1 is defined downstream of clock clk_100 and overrides its insertion delay and/or waveform definition
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-27#1 Critical Warning
Invalid primary clock on hierarchical pin  
A primary clock data_manager_i/clk_wiz_0/inst/clk_in1 is created on an inappropriate internal pin data_manager_i/clk_wiz_0/inst/clk_in1. It is not recommended to create a primary clock on a hierarchical pin when its driver pin has a fanout connected to multiple clock pins
Related violations: <none>

CKLD-2#1 Warning
Clock Net has IO Driver, not a Clock Buf, and/or non-Clock loads  
Clock net Clk_IBUF is directly driven by an IO rather than a Clock Buffer or may be an IO driving a mix of Clock Buffer and non-Clock loads. This connectivity should be reviewed and corrected as appropriate. Driver(s): Clk_IBUF_inst/O, data_manager_i/clk_100MHz, hex_seg_dis/Clk
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#1 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on reset_rtl_0 relative to clock(s) clk_100
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#2 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on hex_gridA[0] relative to clock(s) clk_100
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#3 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on hex_gridA[1] relative to clock(s) clk_100
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#4 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on hex_gridA[2] relative to clock(s) clk_100
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#5 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on hex_gridA[3] relative to clock(s) clk_100
Related violations: <none>
